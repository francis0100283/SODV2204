<p><strong>The Bleak Midwinter: Black IPA</strong></p>
<p>6.5% ABV</p>
<p>Winter</p>
    <pre>

<p><strong>Bright Young Things: Hopped Wheat Ale</strong></p>
<p>5.5% ABV</p>
<p>Summer</p>
    <pre>
    English Summer Ale. A style developed during a late 70’s heat wave 
    in England, this beer is designed to 
    refresh in the hot summer sun. Dry, with a touch of wheat and toasted Victory malt, it is balanced with a 
    touch of bitterness and a sweet citrus aroma. Patios, BBQ’s, and friends all pair perfectly with this beer!</pre>
