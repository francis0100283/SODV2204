                    <p>A fruity Black IPA. With only a kiss of roast, this black IPA is fresh and juicy but dark as the coldest days 
                        of winter. Citra and Mosaic are late hop additions to avoid the bitterness and focus on aroma.</p>

                            <p>English Summer Ale. A style developed during a late 70’s heat wave 
                                in England, this beer is designed to 
                                refresh in the hot summer sun. Dry, with a touch of wheat and toasted Victory malt, it is balanced with a 
                                touch of bitterness and a sweet citrus aroma. Patios, BBQ’s, and friends all pair perfectly with this beer!</p>
