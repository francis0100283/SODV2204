<p><strong>Dandy in the Underworld</strong></p>
<p>5.5% ABV</p>
    <pre>The main Dandy. This beer is our most popular offering and available everywhere, all the time. A light 
    body with notes of coffee, chocolate, and light roast, this traditional Oyster Stout is sure to be a favourite. 
    Pairs well with oysters, fish, and other salty snacks!</pre>

<p><strong>Une Vieille Maitresse</strong></p>
<p>4.5% ABV</p>
    <pre>This farmhouse ale is available year round in the bottle and draught. A table strength beer brewed with 
    rye and french saison yeast. It is light, refreshing, with a touch of spice and saison character. Brewed 
    once as a limited edition, we can't seem to shake this old mistress.</pre>

<p><strong>The Dandy Wild Sour Ale</strong></p>
<p>7.3%</p>
    <pre>A bold, malty sour ale soured with lactobacillus and fermented with a wild yeast strain. An upfront 
    sourness is balanced with wild yeast character for a rich sour experience.</pre>

<p><strong>The Golden Brown Dandy</strong></p>
<p>6% ABV</p>
    <pre>Our English Pale ale. This beer is a low-carbonation ode to real-ale. A smooth malt body is balanced with a highly intensive hops schedule to bring forward a great tasting beer to reward all ale lovers! Available 
    only in bottles and casks. Pairs well with meats, rich sauces and hard, aged cheeses.</pre>
