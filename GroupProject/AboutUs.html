<h1>About Us</h1>
<pre>
    The Dandy Brewing Company is Calgary's original small brewery. Although it has grown a little, it's still 
    small at heart. We produce inspired ales, with lots of care, in small batches.
    Our unique approach to brewing and keen eye to every detail and fosters
    creativity in both our recipes and beer styles.
    
    On site, we are pleased to offer a unique brewery experience, featuring a full service tasting room with 
    an exquisite menu of fine dining drinking food, a curated selection of cocktails, glass pours of selected 
    wines, and 20 taps of Dandy beers. We share a passion for not only brewing, but the people, process, experiences, 
    and personal touches that make the real ale experience so special
